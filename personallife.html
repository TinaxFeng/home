		<h1>John Green's Upbringing</h1>
		<p>John Green was born on August 24th to parents, Sydney and Mike Green. He also has a younger brother named Hank Green, who is very influential in his current day to day life. That however, was not the case when John was younger. As a teenager, John was deeply troubled. He would smoke cigarettes in the woods, skip class, talk back to his teacher... etc. Due to this poor behaviour, his parents decided that he needed to attend a boarding school. Said school was<a class="third" href="https://www.indiansprings.org/"> Indian springs Boarding School.</a> His time at this school is what inspired a lot of his first novel, looking for Alaska. His past shaped the person he is today.</P>
		<h2 class="second">His Struggle With Mental Health</h2>
		<p>Mental health is a deeply personal and unique experience for each of us, John included. He's struggled for the larger half of his life with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. He's not ashamed of his mental illness nor does he try to hide his issues, but sometimes somethings are a little too much for John to handle. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is an intense, often times, uncontrollable urge to follow through with habits. John's OCD manifest's itself mainly in his obsession with bacteria, illness, and death. Aspects of this obsession became the basis for his most recent novel, The Fault in Our Stars. John has never let his mental disorder define him as a person. Yes, he has OCD but he's also a Youtuber, author, father, and friend. He proves that your mental disorder is an aspect of you but there is so much more.</p>
